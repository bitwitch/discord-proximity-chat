## Discord Proximity Chat

A browser extension for proximity chat in Discord voice channels. The extension provides a 2D window populated with avatars of every user in a voice channel. You can click and drag the avatars with your mouse to move them around the window. This will dynamically change the volume of users relative to their distance from your avatar.
